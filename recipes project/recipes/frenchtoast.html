    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>French toast is an easy breakfast or brunch dish that's always a crowd-pleaser. It's a great way to use up extra bread, especially if it's a little stale.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup half-and-half</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>12 slices whole-wheat bread, or another type of bread</li>
        <li>Confectioners' sugar, for serving</li>
        <li>Raspberries, for serving</li>
        <li>Maple syrup, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place a large skillet over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Combine the eggs and half-and-half in a large, shallow bowl. Beat well to combine; stir in the vanilla and salt.</li>
        <li>Place the butter in the skillet and let it melt; swirl the pan to make sure the butter coats the bottom.</li>
        <li>Working in batches (however many will fit in your pan), soak the bread in the egg mixture for 1 minute on each side.</li>
        <li>Lift the bread out of the custard mixture and let it drain briefly before placing it in the skillet. Cook the French toast over medium heat, turning once, until golden brown on both sides, about 5 to 8 minutes. Repeat with the remaining bread and egg mixture.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately with your favorite toppings and enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
