    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Egusi Soup is a rich and savory West African soup made with ground melon seeds and mostly eaten with pounded yam. It is an amazing Nigerian soup the whole family will enjoy because of its rich taste and great nutrients!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Egusi seeds: I used 2 cups for this recipe.</li>
        <li>Meat: I'll be using beef, goat meat and tripe (shaki).</li>
        <li>Vegetables: Tomatoes, bell peppers, onions, habanero peppers, and spinach.</li>
        <li>Palm Oil: Palm oil gives a rich, traditional taste to this soup but you can use olive oil if that is what you have on hand.</li>
        <li>Spices: For Egusi soup, I use ground crayfish, salt, cayenne pepper, and bouillon (Maggi cubes). I also use black pepper to boil the meat.</li>
        <li>Broth/Stock: You can use water if you have none but you will need to add more spices.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the meat: Add about a tablespoon of salt and black pepper to the meat and boil for 30-40 minutes till the meat is tender.</li>
        <li>Prepare the vegetables: Blend the tomatoes, bell pepper, and habanero peppers using a blender with minimal water added.<br>If the blended mixture looks watery, pour it into a bot and let it boil for about 10 minutes, until it becomes a bit thicker.<br>Chop the onions and spinach and set them aside.</li>
        <li>Cook the Egusi soup: Add palm oil to a pot on medium heat. When it gets hot, add the chopped onions.<br>
        Add the blended vegetables to the palm oil and stir for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the meat and broth if you have some on hand, if not just add water. When it boils, add your ground egusi seeds and stir.<br>Add ground crayfish, salt, pepper, and bouillon powder. Let it cook for another 10 minutes on medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Lastly, add the chopped spinach.<br>The spinach should be added at the end because you donâ€™t want it to overcook and become wilted in the soup. Leave on low heat for 5-10 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
