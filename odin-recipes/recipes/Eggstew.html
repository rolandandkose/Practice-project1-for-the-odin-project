    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This egg stew recipe is one of the easiest and quickest Nigerian stews you can make. It tastes incredible and will leave you begging for more!
        <br>
        Egg stew is a favorite in many households in Nigeria due to its versatility. You can eat it any time of the day - for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. 20 minutes is all it takes from start to finish.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Eggs: Six large eggs for this recipe. If you use smaller quantity, they might completely disappear into the stew, so you'll have to increase the quantity.</li>
        <li>Vegetables: Plum tomatoes, red bell pepper, habanero pepper, onion, and garlic.</li>
        <li>Spices: Curry, thyme bouillon, and salt - just a few spices that really pack a punch in flavor!</li>
        <li>Palm oil: Used to sauté the vegetables and cook the eggs.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Coarsely blend the tomatoes, red bell pepper, habanero pepper, and half an onion in a blender.<br>When blending the vegetables, do not add any water to it.</li>
        <li>Chop the other half onion and mince the garlic. Break and whisk the eggs and set aside.</li>
        <li>Pour some olive oil into the pan, and sauté the onion and garlic till fragrant.</li>
        <li>Pour in the blended tomatoes and pepper mix and stir. Let it simmer on medium-high heat until most of the liquid has evaporated. Watch carefully and stir if you need to, so that it doesn't begin to burn.</li>
        <li>Add in your spices - curry, thyme, and bouillon and let it simmer for 2 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour in the eggs and let it cook a bit before you stir. If you stir immediately, the eggs will completely dissolve into the stew. Waiting just a little bit ensures that the eggs will begin to cook before mixed into the stew.</li>
        <li>Stir the eggs until they are well mixed in and cook for about a minute or two. Add salt for taste if you need some.</li>
    </ol>
