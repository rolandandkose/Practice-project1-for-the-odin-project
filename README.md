# Practice-project1-for-the-odin-project
This is going to contain all the projects i'll be doing in the odin project curriculum.

I've done the first one which was a recipe page linking to other pages. Used only html with minimal CSS but i'll style it soon.

The second project will be a landing page design which was provided. Html and CSS will be used.
